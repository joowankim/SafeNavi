# Introduction
- motivation

As the number of single-person households increases, the delivery market is also growing.

Therefore, sales of delivery apps are growing tremendously.

But most of them are delivered by motorcycle.

The rate of accidents is increasing each year.

- solution

Most of the accidents are caused by one eye or another.

For example, you watch a navigation with your cell phone or poor driving.

That's where our thoughts began.

How can we minimize driver accidents?

So we made an eyeglass hud using an aduino and include a navigation function.
